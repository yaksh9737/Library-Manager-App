# E-Library Management System

A full-stack E-Library Management Application where users can browse, borrow, return, and manage eBooks. The frontend is built using React, while the backend uses Node.js, Express, and MongoDB for managing book data and user authentication. The application is fully deployed, offering a seamless and user-friendly experience.

## Features

### Task 1: Frontend Development

- **Book Listing**: Displays a list of available eBooks with filters for genre, author, and publication date.
- **Book Detail View**: Shows details of each eBook, including title, author, genre, publication date, and an option to borrow or return the book.
- **Forms**: Provides forms for adding new books to the library or editing existing book details.
- **Responsive Design**: Ensures a mobile-friendly user interface using Tailwind CSS or Material UI.

### Task 2: Backend Development

- **User Authentication**: Implements JWT-based authentication for secure login and registration.
- **CRUD Operations**: Supports Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations for managing books.
- **Borrow and Return Books**: Allows users to borrow and return eBooks, updating availability in real-time.
- **Error Handling**: Includes robust error handling for invalid requests and server errors.

### Task 3: Full-Stack Integration

- **Frontend and Backend Integration**: Axios is used to connect the React frontend with the Node.js backend for smooth operations such as user authentication, book management, and borrowing/returning eBooks.
- **Deployment**: The frontend is deployed to Vercel/Netlify, and the backend is deployed to Heroku/Render for a fully operational system.
